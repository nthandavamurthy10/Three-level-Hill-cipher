In the field of the data communication the security of the encrypted binary data is a crucial task. In this project, the HILL CIHER algorithm, a symmetric key encryption algorithm is used. It is a classical symmetric cipher based on matrix transformation. Triple Hill cipher algorithm that consists of three stages of the hill cipher is proposed considering each stage a block cipher with the block length of 128 bits and 256 bitsâ€™ key.
To increase the security of message, message to be encrypted is processed by the by the block cipher in three stages and each stage consisting of eight rounds with different eight keys and in each round three operations are implemented: matrix multiplication of plaintext and cipher matrix multiplication, XOR operation and a stir operation. Following the triple DES algorithm, three stage implementations is proposed.
